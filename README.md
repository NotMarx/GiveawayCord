<div align="center"> Above video are the example to start a giveaway interactively or step by step. This way, user can create a giveaway separately from another channel. Just easily type <code> ..create</code> and follow <b> GiveawayCord </b> next instructions. <code> I'd recommend you to use this command separately from the giveaway's channel as once giveaways are created, the instruction's logs and your message won't be deleted.</code></div>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Both above videos are the examples to create giveaways actively and interactively. Both method works differently but it create the same giveaway, bot will still determine winners, ends certainly as with the timer. <code>Since this bot have a limitation to create giveaways, I've manually revamped GiveawayCord by rechecking everything so users CANNOT bypass the limit to create giveaways and there are no possible way you can get a higher chance to win. Bot will determine winners randomly and eveyone have a fair chance to win!</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>GiveawayCord</strong> is an advance giveaway bot that lets you create giveaways quickly and easily. To participate in giveaways, easily react with ðŸŽ‰ . Once the giveaways ended, the bot will determine a random winner(s)! Please keep in mind that right now we're facing a problem where whenever the bot restarted, all giveaways will end. Also, remember that the bot won't go offline. It's 24/7 online and the bot only goes down due to crash (Giveaways Created At Once) or data crashed. <s><strong>We're sorry for the inconvenience.</strong></s> <code>(Fixed)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>FIXED ISSUES:</h2>
<p><strong>10/29/2020 BIGGEST UPDATE:</strong> As currently, most people complain about an issue that might let this bot into a failure. This issue is always happening when <strong>GiveawayCord</strong> can't track all giveaways in every server whenever the bot restarted. This always happening since I did not set up a database to store every giveaway data that were created previously. Since then, I had noticed about it and immediately fix it as it might be a serious problem to every user and server. You can now not to worry of your giveaway timer stopped since this issue had been fixed.</p>

<div align="center"> <h1>Bot's FAQ / Frequently Asked Questions</h1></div>
<h4>1) Does My Giveaways Will Stopped If Bot Is Restarted?</h4>
<p>Nope, starting from <strong>10/29/2020</strong>, GiveawayCord will still keep your giveaway data in a database that allows your giveaway to run even though I restarted the bot multiple times.</p>
<h4>2) My Giveaway Stopped When The Bot Also Offline, And When It's (The Bot) Back, It Shows A Negative Number Of Duration When I Run <code>..list</code>. Anything Wrong?</h4>
<p>Therefore seems to be wrong but we don't mind it. It only happens when your giveaway supposes to end but it doesn't. And this won't affect your giveaway at all. Your giveaways still can run perfectly fine.</p>
<h4>3) How Do I Edit The Duration Of A Giveaway In Editing Mode?</h4>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>..edit 638207462091 10m 2w Free Robux</code>, will change the duration to 10 minutes instead of adding another 10 minutes to prevent users from bypassing the limitations of hosting a giveaway.</p>
<h4>4) Can I Make My Giveaway Have A Requirement And Only Certain Roles Can Participate?</h4>
<p>Technically, it's a <strong>NO</strong> but you can do it. For the requirement, make sure that the winners have followed your requirement, if winners did not complete the requirement, you can reroll. And for certain roles, make sure that your channel only can be seen by those who have certain roles.</p>
<h4>5) Will There Be Any Future Plans Like FAQ 4?</h4>
<p>Nope, I have <code>0%</code> of planning to add them since this giveaway bot are designed to be easy, simple, and quick. Giveaway Bot will allow all participants to participate in all giveaways, as long as the giveaways are visible for everyone.</p>
<h4>6) How Can I Able To Unlock The Premium Features?</h4>
<p>Currently, you're only able to unlock its Premium Features when you're boosting <strong>GiveawayCord</strong>'s Support Server which is <a target="_blank" onclick="trackCampaignWebClick('', 'description');" rel="nofollow" href="https://discord.gg/78RyqJK">discord.gg/78RyqJK</a>.</p>
